Architecture
============
Sitka aims to bring modeling for building performance to Python.  As much as
possible Pandas is used as a container for time series data.  The intent is
to allow Python objects to be directly embedded into Python data analysis
pipelines.

Documentation
=============
Docstrings follow the numpy docstrings format (https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
